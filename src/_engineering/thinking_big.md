# Think Big. And Take Small Steps.

Engineers and team members are encouraged to "Think Big" in regards to the future of our product, our architecture, and our team. At the same time, in a spirit of kindness, we show respect to our colleagues by taking ownership of the process of breaking up our own big vision into small incremental steps.

In practice, this roughly translates to the following:

1. Consider your readers' time.
   - Target 5-10 minutes read time, 1-3 minutes to scan.
   - Until an issue is prioritized by Product and Engineering leadership, keep word limit to no more than 1 printed page.
   - Use bullets whenever possible and nest your points to aid readers when scanning.
2. Log problems separate from proposals.
   - If your proposal solves a problem, make sure the problems are logged _first_ and then link to them.
3. Reference philosophical arguments and best practices as benefits, but sparingly, and never as the _reasons_ for the proposals.
   - Constructive: "This solution is nice because it is DRY."
   - Constructive: "I like this solution because it is DRY."
   - Not constructive: "We need this because our code should be DRY."
4. Less is more. Start small.
5. Only one big idea per issue.
